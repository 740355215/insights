# Insights

As our [education marketplace](https://www.apprentus.com) grew, we faced a dilemma: we had little visibility into our data.

Questions such as *"who is our best customer?"*, *"which target countries are gaining in sales?"* or *"what are our most popular categories for paid leads?"* required tinkering in the Rails console or writing custom stats pages. We lost *a lot* of developer time over the years.

So we started looking for the best **Business Intelligence** solution out there.

Unfortunately, they all had their problems. Some required knowledge of SQL. Some made multi-table data exploration a pain. Most cost an arm, a leg and an iPhone. Per month.

The best tool we found was [Looker](https://looker.com/), but at a monthly price equal to our burn rate, it wouldn't work.

So I decided to re-implement the essential parts of Looker as an open source alternative.

**Insights** is a desktop or self-hosted "SQL-not-required" data analytics and business intelligence tool. Featuring linkable URLs, easy data exploration, automatic joins, graphs, exports, facets (pivots), saveable views, pretty colors and a ridiculously permissive license (MIT).

It's a work in progress and you're brave for checking it out! Cheers!

## Installing

To install, make sure you have Node 7.6+ installed and then run:

```
# server version
npm install -g insights insights-core insights-server
insights createsuperuser  # create an admin user to access the server
insights createsecret     # create a new authentication secret at ~/.insights/secret
insights server           # run the server
```

Read the [deployment guide](https://github.com/mariusandra/insights/blob/master/docs/deployment.md) if you wish to run this on a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 instance.

## How does it work

Similar to Looker and their LookML, Insights requires a mapping of your database's structure to function.

This mapping is either autogenerated from your schema and foreign keys, or created with scripts such as the [`insights_export`](https://github.com/mariusandra/insights_export) gem, which exports Rails (ActiveRecord) associations.

Once you have a mapping, you may then edit it to add custom columns (e.g. `full_name: first_name || ' ' || last_name`), hide existing fields (e.g. `encrypted_password`) or hide entire models.

(Note: as of this moment, it's only possible to edit the mapping if you generate the .yml file manually. The editor for the autogenerated structures is coming soon!)

## How to use

[Play with the demo here](http://insights-demo.mariusandra.com/) and try to answer the following questions:

1. Which product has been bought the most? ([solution](http://insights-demo.mariusandra.com/explorer?columns=Product.title%2CProduct.order_lines.total_price_in_eur%21%21sum%2CProduct.order_lines.id%21%21count%2CProduct.order_lines.quantity%21%21avg&facetsColumn=&facetsCount=6&graphCumulative=false&graphTimeFilter=last-60&percentages=false&redirect_path=explorer&sort=-Product.order_lines.total_price_in_eur%21%21sum&treeState=Product%2CProduct.order_lines))
2. Sales by country by month ([solution](http://insights-demo.mariusandra.com/explorer?columns=Order.total_price_in_eur!!sum%2COrder.user.country.name%2COrder.confirmed_at!month&sort=-Order.confirmed_at!day&treeState=Order%2COrder.user%2COrder.user.country&graphTimeFilter=last-365&facetsColumn=Order.user.country.name&facetsCount=6&graphCumulative=false&percentages=false&filter%5B0%5D=Order.confirmed%3Dequals%3Atrue)) - export it as a PDF as well!
3. Sales by delivery status ([solution](http://insights-demo.mariusandra.com/explorer?columns=Order.total_price_in_eur!!sum%2COrder.user.country.name%2COrder.status%2COrder.created_at!month&sort=-Order.created_at!day&treeState=Order%2COrder.user%2COrder.user.country&graphTimeFilter=last-365&facetsColumn=Order.status&facetsCount=6&graphCumulative=false&percentages=false))
4. Where are your users from ([solution](http://insights-demo.mariusandra.com/explorer?columns=User.country.name%2CUser.id!!count&sort=-User.id!!count&treeState=User%2CUser.country&graphTimeFilter=last-365&facetsColumn=User.country.name&facetsCount=6&graphCumulative=false&percentages=false))
5. ... by month? ([solution](http://insights-demo.mariusandra.com/explorer?columns=User.country.name%2CUser.id!!count%2CUser.created_at!month&sort=-User.created_at!day&treeState=User%2CUser.country&graphTimeFilter=last-365&facetsColumn=User.country.name&facetsCount=6&graphCumulative=false&percentages=false))
6. ... only ones with confirmed orders? ([solution](http://insights-demo.mariusandra.com/explorer?columns=User.country.name%2CUser.id!!count%2CUser.created_at!month%2CUser.orders.confirmed&sort=-User.created_at!day&treeState=User%2CUser.country%2CUser.orders&graphTimeFilter=last-365&facetsColumn=User.country.name&facetsCount=6&graphCumulative=false&percentages=false&filter%5B0%5D=User.orders.confirmed%3Dequals%3Atrue))

Hint: to count rows, select the `id` field and then `count` from the table header.

## Coming soon

* Structure editor in the interface
* Manage users in the interface
* PDF and XLSX exports (they worked on the old Rails version, but have to be ported to NodeJS)
* Better graph controls
* Graphs that don't require a time column
* View generated SQL
* Dashboard item grouping/tabbing
* Multiple lines from different sources on one chart in the dashboard
* Polishing


## Development

`insights` is built as a monorepo and uses `oao` for package management, at least until yarn workspaces become a thing. `oao` uses yarn internally, so you need to have it installed as well.

If you want to help with development, run these steps:

```sh
# 1. fork the repo in github

# 2. clone it
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_NAME_HERE>/insights.git

# 3. install all dependencies
cd insights
yarn

# 4. run the development environment
yarn start

# 5. open http://localhost:3030/ and hack away
```

### How to publish new versions

Here's the latest workflow to publish a new version. This may change in the future.

```sh
# install oao
npm install -g oao

# optional: check if the core builds as needed.
yarn run build:core

# update the versions of the repos under packages/* and the root repo
oao all "npm version patch"
git add .
git commit -m 'update package versions'
npm version patch

# sync package.jsons
oao prepublish

# publish
oao all "npm publish"

# NB! don't run 'npm publish' on its own: there is no need to publish the insights-build package.
```

At this beta moment you need to do:

```sh
cd packages/insights-charts
yarn link
cd ../../packages/insights-core
yarn link insights-charts
```
