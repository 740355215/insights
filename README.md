# Insights

**Insights** is a desktop or self-hosted "SQL-not-required" data analytics and business intelligence tool. Featuring linkable URLs, easy data exploration, automatic joins, graphs, exports, facets (pivots), saveable views, pretty colors and a ridiculously permissive license (MIT).

It's a work in progress and you're brave for checking it out! Cheers!

## Installing

To install, make sure you have Node 7.6+ installed and then run:

```
npm install -g insights
insights init --no-login
insights start
```

This creates a folder `.insights` which contains all the config and runtime data.

Skip `--no-login` if you wish to deploy it on a server and want to configure real users!

## How does it work

Similar to Looker and their LookML, Insights requires a mapping of your database's structure to function.

This mapping is either autogenerated from your schema and foreign keys, or created with scripts such as the [`insights_export`](https://github.com/mariusandra/insights_export) gem, which exports Rails (ActiveRecord) associations.

Once you have a mapping, you may then edit it to add custom columns (e.g. `full_name: first_name || ' ' || last_name`), hide existing fields (e.g. `encrypted_password`) or hide entire models.

(Note: as of this moment, it's only possible to edit the mapping if you generate the .yml file manually. The editor for the autogenerated structures is coming soon!)


## Coming soon

* Structure editor in the interface
* Export graphs as iframes or react components for easy embedding
* Manage users in the interface
* PDF and XLSX exports (they worked on the old Rails version, but have to be ported to NodeJS)
* Better graph controls
* Graphs that don't require a time column
* View generated SQL
* Dashboard item grouping/tabbing
* Multiple lines from different sources on one chart in the dashboard
* Polishing


## Development

If you want to help with development, run these steps:

```sh
# 1. fork the repo in github

# 2. clone it
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_NAME_HERE>/insights.git

# 3. install all dependencies
cd insights
yarn

# 4. run the development environment
yarn run init --no-login
yarn start

# 5. open http://localhost:3000/ and hack away
```
